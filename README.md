Code for structural and practical identifiability of two cancer chemotherapy models. This is the source code for:

The code given here will simulate the taxol compartmental chemotherapy model described in the above manuscript (and the oxaliplatin model with minor modifications as well), and fit it to in vitro experimental data. The control data fitting code can be found in the `Control Data Code` folder. Code to run profile likelihoods to examine structural and practical identifiability is given in the `Profile Likelihood` folder (currently set up to profile ùõº<sub>0</sub>, but can be used for any of the parameters). The current code is a bit rough, but we'll be finalizing it over the next few weeks. To run the code, start with `TaxolTx_fit.m`
